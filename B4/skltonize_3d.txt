def skeletonize_3d(image):
    """Compute the skeleton of a binary image.

    Thinning is used to reduce each connected component in a binary image
    to a single-pixel wide skeleton.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray, 2D or 3D
        A binary image containing the objects to be skeletonized. Zeros
        represent background, nonzero values are foreground.

    Returns
    -------
    skeleton : ndarray
        The thinned image.

    See Also
    --------
    skeletonize, medial_axis

    Notes
    -----
    The method of [Lee94]_ uses an octree data structure to examine a 3x3x3
    neighborhood of a pixel. The algorithm proceeds by iteratively sweeping
    over the image, and removing pixels at each iteration until the image
    stops changing. Each iteration consists of two steps: first, a list of
    candidates for removal is assembled; then pixels from this list are
    rechecked sequentially, to better preserve connectivity of the image.

    The algorithm this function implements is different from the algorithms
    used by either `skeletonize` or `medial_axis`, thus for 2D images the
    results produced by this function are generally different.
